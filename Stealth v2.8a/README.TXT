NEW 2.8a Code has added "Dino Mode"
New Stealth2.8a (7 Wire) Code detects when to shut the chip down from a signal in the
 Playstation. This idea has been defeated by Sony's release of "Dino Crisis" which was
 a deliberate attack on Stealth chips.
In response to this we have added "Dino Mode" to our code ...if you hold down the reset
 button for at least 3 seconds you enter "Dino Mode 1" this may or may not load "Dino 
Crisis" on your model .. if it doesnt then press the reset again to enter "Dino Mode 2"
 .. keep going until the game loads ... there are 10 "Dino Modes" after pressing the 
reset for 11 times the chip will be disabled until you power the machine off and then
 back on.
This chip has been Tested on 100x , 55xx , 700x, 750x and 9xxx Models and we have had 
NO complaints about the code failing with ANY protected games to date :-)
